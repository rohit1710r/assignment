           <p><b> Web designing</b> is the process of planning, conceptualizing, and implementing the plan for designing a website in a way that is functional and offers a good user experience. User experience is central to the web designing process. Websites have an array of elements presented in ways that make them easy to navigate. Web designing essentially involves working on every attribute of the website that people interact with, so that the website is simple and efficient, allows users to quickly find the information they need, and looks visually pleasing. All these factors, when combined, decide how well the website is designed.<br/>

          <h2> What Do Web Designers Do?</h2> <br/>

         <p> <b> Web designers</b> create the design and layout of a website with their technical expertise and knowledge while keeping in mind the client’s requirements. They have a deep understanding of UI (user interface) and UX (user experience) and are adept at using design programs for creating visual elements. With their skills and expertise, web designers capture the brand’s identity in the design elements of the website.<br/>
         </p>

          <p> Visitors rate their experience with a specific website based on its aesthetics and how intuitive it is in terms of navigation. Therefore, web designers use Adobe, CorelDraw, Inkscape, and other design programs to create animations, graphics, icons, logos, and other elements of a website to make it as interactive as possible. Web designers also focus on the creative and visual side of the website and follow various design practices, such as symmetry, color systems, proportions, etc. to engage visitors. Additionally, they work on fonts, placement of images and videos, and creating layouts using coding languages.<br/>
